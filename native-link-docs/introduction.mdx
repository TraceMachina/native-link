Native Link is a high-performance project crafted in Rust, designed to serve as a Bazel cache service (CAS) that adheres to the [Remote Execution protocol](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis). This means it efficiently stores and manages build artifacts, ensuring stability, speed, and low resource usage.

**The goals of this project are:**
<Steps>
  <Step title="Stability">
    Things should work out of the box as expected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Efficiency">
    Don't waste time on inefficiencies &amp; low resource usage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User First">
    Design choices should be optimized for what users want.
  </Step>
