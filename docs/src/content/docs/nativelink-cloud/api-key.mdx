## GitHub Actions
GitHub Repository Secrets is the recommended way
to store your NativeLink Cloud API keys
for use with GitHub Actions.

[GitHub Repository Secrets Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository)

They can be access via the secrets context i.e.
```bash
${{ secrets.YourSecretKeyName }}
```

### Read Only keys
:::note
If your repository uses forks for pull requests (PRs), note that the secrets
context isn't accessible from PRs originating from forks. To address this,
we introduced Read-Only keys.
:::

Read-Only keys can be used for PRs and stored in the vars context. For
merge-to-main actions, use a Read/Write key stored in the secrets context.

For Read Only API Keys you need to set these two flags:

```bash
--nogenerate_json_trace_profile
--remote_upload_local_results=false
```

## Third-Party Secrets Management
