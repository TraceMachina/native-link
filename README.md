# Turbo Cache

[![CI](https://github.com/allada/turbo-cache/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/allada/turbo-cache/actions/workflows/main.yml)

An extremely fast and efficient bazel cache service (CAS) written in rust.

The goals of this project are:
1. Stability - Things should work out of the box as expected
2. Efficiency - Don't waste time on inefficiencies & low resource usage
3. Tested - Components should have plenty of tests & each bug should be regression tested
4. Customers First - Design choices should be optimized for what customers want

## Overview

Turbo Cache is a project that implements the [Bazel Remote Execution protocol](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis) (the CAS/cache portion).

When properly configured this project will provide extremely fast and efficient build cache for any systems that communicate using the [BRE protocol](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis/blob/main/build/bazel/remote/execution/v2/remote_execution.proto).

## Example Deployments
We currently have two example deployments in [deployment-examples directory](https://github.com/allada/turbo-cache/tree/master/deployment-examples).

### Terraform
The [terraform deployment](https://github.com/allada/turbo-cache/tree/master/deployment-examples/terraform) is the currently preferred method as it leverages a lot of AWS cloud resources to make everything much more robust.

The terraform deployment is very easy to setup and configure, all you need is a domain or subdomain that you can add some DNS records to and an AWS account. This deployment will show off remote execution capabilities and cache capabilities.

## Status

This project is still under active development, but all major components do work as expected and no major API changes are expected. Using with production systems are welcome and would be happy to work closely to hammer out any issues that might arise.

## History

This project was first created due to frustration with similar projects not working or being extremely inefficient. Rust was chosen as the language to write it in because at the time rust was going through a revolution in the new-ish feature `async-await`. This made making multi-threading extremely simple when paired with a runtime (like [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)) while still giving all the lifetime and other protections that Rust gives. This pretty much guarantees that we will never have crashes due to race conditions. This kind of project seemed perfect, since there is so much asynchronous activity happening and running them on different threads is most preferable. Other languages like `Go` are good candidates, but other similar projects rely heavily channels and mutex locks which are cumbersome and have to be carefully designed by the developer. Rust doesn't have these issues, since the compiler will always tell you when the code you are writing might introduce undefined behavior. The last major reason is because Rust is extremely fast, +/- a few percent of C++ and has no garbage collection (like C++, but unlike `Java`, `Go`, or `Typescript`).

## Build Requirements
* Linux (most recent versions) (untested on Windows, but might work)
* Bazel 5.0.0+
* `libssl-dev` package installed (ie: `apt install libssl-dev` or `yum install libssl-dev`)

### Building for deployment
```
$ bazel build -c opt //cas
```

> **Note**
> Failing to use the `-c opt` flag will result in a very slow binary (~10x slower). 

### Building for development
```
$ bazel build //cas
```

These will place an executable in `./bazel-bin/cas/cas` that will start the service.

### Configure

Configuration is done via a JSON file that is passed in as the first parameter to the `cas` program. See [here](https://github.com/allada/turbo-cache/tree/master/config) for more details and examples.

## How to update external rust deps

All dependencies are tracked in a generated `@crate_index` workspace and locked
in `Cargo.Bazel.lock`. To regenerate the `@crate_index`:

```bash
CARGO_BAZEL_REPIN=1 bazel sync --only=crate_index
```
