## GitHub Actions
GitHub Repository Secrets is the recommended way
to store your NativeLink Cloud API keys
for use with GitHub Actions.

[GitHub Repository Secrets Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository)

They can be access via the secrets context i.e.
```
${{ secrets.YourSecretKeyName }}
```

:::note
If your repository uses forks for pull requests (PRs), note that the secrets
context isn't accessible from PRs originating from forks. To address this,
we will soon introduce Read-Only keys.

Read-Only keys can be used for PRs and stored in the vars context. For
merge-to-main actions, use a Read/Write key stored in the secrets context.
