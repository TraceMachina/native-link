Background
Samsung Internet, a Chromium-based browser, has been an integral part of
Samsung's product lineup, requiring robust and efficient build infrastructure
to keep up with its evolving complexity. With a need for more advanced
solutions due to increasing build complexity and domain variety, the Samsung
Internet team sought a tool that could provide remote execution and build
caching at scale.


Challenges
Increased build complexity - The heterogeneous nature of Samsung Internet's
builds required a solution capable of handling complex compositions across
different executors.
Inefficient ad-hoc solutions - Existing ad-hoc solutions were becoming
inefficient and unscalable with the expanding variety and complexity of build
domains.
Need for remote execution - The team needed a remote execution solution to
manage build complexity efficiently and to push tasks to the most appropriate
execution environments.

Solution
Samsung Internet adopted NativeLink to address these challenges, leveraging
its remote execution platform and build caching capabilities. This
integration enabled Samsung to streamline their build processes and
significantly reduce build times.


Implementation
Remote execution and build caching - NativeLink's robust architecture allowed
Samsung Internet to efficiently manage their build processes by utilizing
remote execution and build caching. This not only simplified their
infrastructure but also made it more scalable.
Scalable infrastructure - NativeLink's ability to scale across commodity
hardware allowed Samsung Internet to optimize their build processes and push
tasks to the most efficient execution environments.
Improved efficiency - The integration of NativeLink brought down the
engineering time and simplified the inspection of infrastructure, making it
easier to manage builds across various domains.

Results
Reduced build times - The implementation of NativeLink reduced Samsung
Internet's build times from several days to just one to two hours. This
significant improvement allowed the team to work more efficiently and
effectively.
Simulated system behavior on specialized bare metal hardware - Running the
original builds on specialized hardware without any build acceleration took
days. Using NativeLinkâ€™s segmented solution, Samsung Internet was able to
reduce this time dramatically, highlighting the efficiency and scalability of
the tool.
Enhanced scalability - The scalable nature of NativeLink's infrastructure
enabled Samsung Internet to handle increased build complexity and domain
variety without compromising on efficiency.
Future-proofing development - By adopting NativeLink, Samsung Internet
positioned itself to better handle future development needs, especially with
the potential to improve storage density and overall system efficiency.

Conclusion
The adoption of NativeLink by Samsung Internet has proven to be a
game-changer, enabling the team to efficiently manage complex builds, reduce
build times, and scale their infrastructure effectively. This integration
highlights the potential of NativeLink to significantly enhance development
processes for large-scale projects.
