# Native Link

[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink)
[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/8050/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/8050)

Native Link is an extremely (blazingly?) fast and efficient build cache and
remote executor for systems that communicate using the [Remote execution
protocol](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis/blob/main/build/bazel/remote/execution/v2/remote_execution.proto) such as [Bazel](https://bazel.build), [Buck2](https://buck2.build), [Goma](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/goma/client/) and
[Reclient](https://github.com/bazelbuild/reclient).

Supports Unix-based operating systems and Windows.

## Getting Started with Native Link

Below, you will find a few different options for getting started with Native Link.


### ü¶Ä Installing with Cargo

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink --tag v0.2.0
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The `nativelink` executable reads a JSON file as it's only parameter,
`--config`. See [nativelink-config](https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/blob/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json)
for more details and examples.

To grab the example in your current working directory, run:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json
```

### Start Native Link

```bash
nativelink basic_cas.json
```

## üß™ Evaluating Native Link

Once you've built Native Link and have an instance running with the
`basic_cas.json` configuration, launch a separate terminal session and run the
following command to connect the running server launched above to Bazel or
another RBE client:

```sh
bazel test //... \
  --remote_instance_name=main \
  --remote_cache=grpc://127.0.0.1:50051 \
  --remote_executor=grpc://127.0.0.1:50051 \
  --remote_default_exec_properties=cpu_count=1
```

For Windows Powershell;

```powershell
bazel test //... `
  --remote_instance_name=main `
  --remote_cache=grpc://127.0.0.1:50051 `
  --remote_executor=grpc://127.0.0.1:50051 `
  --remote_default_exec_properties=cpu_count=1
```
This causes Bazel to run the commands through an all-in-one `CAS`, `scheduler`
and `worker`.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Installing with Nix

**Installation requirements:**

* Nix with [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) enabled

This build does not require cloning the repository, but you need to provide a
config file, for instance the one at [nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json](https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/blob/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json).

The following command builds and runs Native Link in release (optimized) mode:

```sh
nix run github:TraceMachina/nativelink ./basic_cas.json
```

For use in production pin the executable to a specific revision:

```sh
nix run github:TraceMachina/nativelink/<revision> ./basic_cas.json
```

## üå± Building with Bazel

**Build requirements:**

* Bazel 6.4.0+
* A recent C++ toolchain with LLD as linker

> [!TIP]
> This build supports Nix/direnv which provides Bazel but no C++ toolchain
> (yet).

The following commands places an executable in `./bazel-bin/nativelink` and
starts the service:

```sh
# Unoptimized development build on Unix
bazel run nativelink -- ./nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json

# Optimized release build on Unix
bazel run -c opt nativelink -- ./nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json

# Unoptimized development build on Windows
bazel run --config=windows nativelink -- ./nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json

# Optimized release build on Windows
bazel run --config=windows -c opt nativelink -- ./nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json
```

## ü¶Ä Building with Cargo

**Build requirements:**

* Cargo 1.74.0+
* A recent C++ toolchain with LLD as linker

> [!TIP]
> This build supports Nix/direnv which provides Cargo but no C++
> toolchain/stdenv (yet).

```bash
# Unoptimized development build
cargo run --bin nativelink -- ./nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json

# Optimized release build
cargo run --release --bin nativelink -- ./nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json
```

## üöÄ Example Deployments

You can find a few example deployments in the [deployment-examples directory](./deployment-examples).

See the [terraform deployments](./deployment-examples/terraform) for an example
deployments that show off remote execution and cache capabilities.

## üè∫ History

This project was first created due to frustration with similar projects not
working or being extremely inefficient. Rust was chosen as the language to write
it in because at the time Rust was going through a revolution in the new-ish
feature `async-await`. This made making multi-threading extremely simple when
paired with a runtime like [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) while
still giving all the lifetime and other protections that Rust gives. This pretty
much guarantees that we will never have crashes due to race conditions. This
kind of project seemed perfect, since there is so much asynchronous activity
happening and running them on different threads is most preferable. Other
languages like `Go` are good candidates, but other similar projects rely heavily
on channels and mutex locks which are cumbersome and have to be carefully
designed by the developer. Rust doesn't have these issues, since the compiler
will always tell you when the code you are writing might introduce undefined
behavior. The last major reason is because Rust is extremely fast, +/- a few
percent of C++ and has no garbage collection (like C++, but unlike `Java`, `Go`,
or `Typescript`).
