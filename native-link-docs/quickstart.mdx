## Setup your development

There are a few pre-requisites to get started if you do not use Docker to use NativeLink.

### Install or Update Rust

<CodeGroup>

```shell  Install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

```shell Update
rustup update
```
</CodeGroup>

### Bazel Dependencies

* Bazel 6.4.0+
* gcc
* g++
* lld
* python3
* curl

<CodeGroup>

```shell Linux
apt install -y gcc g++ lld python3 curl

sudo apt update && sudo apt install bazel

# Verify the installation.
bazel --version
```

```shell Docker-ARM
docker run -it --name=NL -v $(pwd):/native-link ubuntu:latest

# If above has already been run or trying to start in new terminal:
docker exec -it NL bash

apt update

apt install apt-transport-https curl gnupg

# Download the Bazel binary for ARM Linux.
curl -LO https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/6.4.0/bazel-6.4.0-linux-arm64

# Make the binary executable.
chmod +x bazel-6.4.0-linux-arm64

# Move the binary to a directory in your PATH.
mv bazel-6.4.0-linux-arm64 /usr/local/bin/bazel

# Verify the installation.
bazel --version

```

```shell Docker-x86
docker run -it --name=NL -v $(pwd):/native-link ubuntu:latest

# If above has already been run or trying to start in new terminal:
docker exec -it NL bash

apt update

apt install apt-transport-https curl gnupg

# Download the Bazel binary for x86 Linux.
curl -LO https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/6.4.0/bazel-6.4.0-linux-x86_64

# Make the binary executable.
chmod +x bazel-6.4.0-linux-x86_64

# Move the binary to a directory in your PATH.
mv bazel-6.4.0-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/bazel

# Verify the installation.
bazel --version

```

```shell MacOS (Beta)
# It is recommended to use x86 Docker for Intel Macs and ARM Docker for Silicon Macs.
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

brew install bazel

# Verify the installation.
bazel --version
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>The commands for creating docker containers can fill up space very quickly when run frequently. If `apt update` throws an out of space error you can run `docker system prune` to free up space. Be careful to make sure it's not removing any containers/images you want to keep.</Note>

### Compile and Run NativeLink Server

The following command will allow you to compile and run the NativeLink server for the first time.
  
  ```shell
  apt install -y gcc g++ lld python3
  # Install cargo (if needed).
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
  cargo run --release --bin cas -- ./native-link-config/examples/basic_cas.json
  ```

<Note>The `--release` flag causes link-time-optmization to be enabled, which can take a while to compile, but will result in a much faster binary.</Note>

In a seprate terminal, run the following command to start the NativeLink client.


```shell
bazel test //... \
  --remote_instance_name=main \
  --remote_cache=grpc://127.0.0.1:50051 \
  --remote_executor=grpc://127.0.0.1:50051 \
  --remote_default_exec_properties=cpu_count=1
```
<Note>If the NativeLink server was run in a docker container, the above command for starting the NativeLink client will need to be run in the same container as the server in order to connect.</Note>


### That's It!

NativeLink is now running and you can start using it in your projects.
