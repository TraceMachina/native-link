NativeLink is a NativeLink a build cache and remote execution server
and provides the ability to connect to your Buck2 or Bazel client
setups through small additions to your `.buckconfig` or `.bazelrc`.

By integrating remote caching via our **free** hosted cloud,
you could potentially save **+90%** on your compute resources and
significantly accelerate your build times.

## Setup Options

- **[NativeLink Cloud](/nativelink-cloud/bazel/)**:
Our hosted solution offers remote caching and execution services.
It's free to use and can drastically improve your build speeds while
reducing your compute costs.

- **[NativeLink On-Prem](/deployment-examples/on-prem-overview/)**:
This option enables you to deploy NativeLink within your own infrastructure,
providing full control over your data and the flexibility to tailor the setup
to your specific needs.

If you have any questions especially on unique compliance requirements
that necessitate an on-prem setup, don't hesitate to reach out on our
