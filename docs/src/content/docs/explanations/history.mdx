This project was first created due to frustration with similar projects not
working or being inefficient. Rust got chosen as the language to
write it in because at the time Rust was going through a revolution in the
new-ish feature async-await. This made making multi-threading more accessible
when paired with a runtime like Tokio while still giving all the lifetime and
other protections that Rust gives. This pretty much guarantees
never having crashes due to race conditions. This kind of project seemed perfect,
since there is so much asynchronous activity happening and running them on
different threads is most preferable. Other languages like Go are good
candidates, but other similar projects rely a lot on channels and mutex locks
which are cumbersome and require careful design by the developer. Rust
doesn't have these issues, since the compiler will always tell you when the code
you are writing might introduce undefined behavior. The last major reason is
because Rust is fast, comparable to C++ and has no garbage collection
(like C++, but unlike Java, Go, or Typescript).
