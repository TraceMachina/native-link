Remote processing is a powerful feature that allows you to distribute build
and test actions across different machines, such as a data center.
This can speed up your build times and improve your development workflow.

By leveraging remote processing, you can enjoy the following benefits:

- **Faster build and test operation**: By distributing actions across different nodes,
you can carry out builds and tests in parallel, reducing the time required.
- **Consistent processing environment**: Remote processing ensures that all members of
a development team are working in the same environment, reducing the
"it works on this machine" problem.
- **Reuse of build outputs**: You can share build outputs across a development team,
 reducing redundant work and further speeding up the development process.

For more information on how to get started with remote execution in NativeLink,
please refer to [NativeLink On-Prem Guide](https://docs.nativelink.com/introduction/on-prem).
